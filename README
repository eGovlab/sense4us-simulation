Fuck the shebang. Send it through to the interpreter instead.

            E.g.: National level, Sweden

2. Define scope (set boundaries) of the policy analysis
        Time aspect
            Short term
            Medium
            Long term
        Impact assessment

            Origin node: Meteor
            Link between these two nodes where meteor have a negative impact on population.
    /* 1. Create end nodes, maybe with goals in mind. */
    2.
