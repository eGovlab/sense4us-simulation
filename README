When developing
1.	$ npm start
	This will run npm install and then start the application
2.	$ npm watch
	This will run watcherify on the public javascripts, which means the javascript will be re-compiled whenever main.js or a file included in main.js is edited. It will compile using browserify in debug mode, which means you get a sourcemap in the bundle.js, which means chrome debugging will show you the errors in separate files instead of in the bundle.js.

When deploying
1.	Setup som cool server or something
2.	$ npm browserify
	This will run browserify on the public javascript, and then uglify it.

To generate the code documentation:
1.	Install YUIDoc (http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/)
	1.1	For the lazy: $ npm install -g yuidocjs
2.	Go to the root of the project and execute cmdline: "yuidoc ."

Start Nodejs
1.	'node backend.js' from the directory. Most paths work from current working directory, unfortunately. Will fix!!!
